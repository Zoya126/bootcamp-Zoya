    <h2>Summary of Challenges and Points Overcome</h2>
    <pre>
The following are the challenges I faced and the points I overcame and learnt:

1. **Font Weights and System Fonts**: Initially, I faced challenges with applying different font weights to specific classes. After researching, I learned how to use `font-weight` property to control text weights and applied it successfully to various sections.

2. **Google Fonts Integration**: The integration of Google Fonts was easy, but understanding how variable fonts work took time. I learned that variable fonts allow more flexibility with font weight and style, which I demonstrated by applying different weights to various elements.

3. **Text Effects (Drop Cap, Shadow, etc.)**: Implementing the drop cap effect and text shadow was a bit tricky. However, using `::first-letter` pseudo-element for the drop cap and `text-shadow` for the shadow effect helped me achieve the desired results.

4. **Custom Fonts**: Installing and using a custom font like Geist from Vercel was new to me. I had to ensure that the font was correctly loaded from the source and applied to the relevant elements.

5. **Typographic Hierarchy**: Combining multiple font families for creating a typographic hierarchy (e.g., using serif for headings and sans-serif for body text) was essential to give the page a clear structure. I used Google Fonts like Roboto and Courier Prime to achieve this.
