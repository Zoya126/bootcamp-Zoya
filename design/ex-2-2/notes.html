  <h1>What I Learned and Challenges Faced</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <div class="note">
      <h2>Level 1: Color Themes and Card Design</h2>
      <p>I learned how to create monochromatic, complementary, and three-color schemes. The use of alpha channels for background, borders, and shadows helped create subtle differentiation for the card elements.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring the contrast between elements was clear, especially when applying complementary color schemes. I had to carefully adjust the shades to avoid overwhelming the user.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h2>Level 2: Dark and Light Themes with CSS Variables</h2>
      <p>I learned how to use CSS variables to define primary, secondary, and background colors, and how to create separate stylesheets for dark and light themes. I also learned how to adjust image overlays for text contrast.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring proper contrast for text over images in both dark and light themes. The challenge was maintaining readability while keeping the design aesthetically pleasing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h2>Level 2: Color Swatches and HSL Variations</h2>
      <p>Creating a color swatch page using HSL values was a valuable exercise. I learned how to generate color variations by adjusting saturation and lightness, and how to organize them in a grid layout.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Understanding how HSL values affect color perception, especially when working with variations in saturation and lightness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h2>Level 3: Gradient Themes and Responsive Color Palette</h2>
      <p>I learned how to design gradient themes using linear and radial gradients. I also explored responsive design by creating a color palette with tints and shades, applying them dynamically based on screen size.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring that gradients and responsive color palettes worked well across different devices and screen sizes. It was tricky to get the right balance of color contrast and readability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h2>Level 3: Contrast Demonstration and Accessibility</h2>
      <p>I created a contrast demonstration page to ensure that different color combinations met accessibility standards. I used borders and shadows to enhance visual hierarchy and improve user experience.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Making sure the color combinations met WCAG accessibility guidelines. It was a bit challenging to balance aesthetics with accessibility, but it was an important lesson.</p>
