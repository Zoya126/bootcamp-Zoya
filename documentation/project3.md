# **Clinical Trials Dashboard**

## **Problem Statement**
The healthcare and pharmaceutical industries rely heavily on clinical trials to develop and validate new treatments, drugs, and medical devices. Clinical trials involve multiple phases, including laboratory testing, animal testing, and human trials, to ensure the safety and efficacy of treatments.

However, accessing detailed and up-to-date information about ongoing, completed, or recruiting trials for specific conditions can be challenging for researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients. Existing platforms like [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) provide access to such data, but their interfaces can be overwhelming or non-intuitive for users.

The goal of this project is to create an **interactive Clinical Trials Dashboard** that:
1. Provides a user-friendly interface to query and display clinical trial data using APIs.
2. Allows users to filter and sort trials based on various parameters (e.g., condition, age group, gender, trial phase).
3. Offers a detailed view of individual trials, including participation criteria, location, and status.

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Integrate APIs:** Use the public APIs provided by clinicaltrials.gov to fetch and display data dynamically.
2. **Create an Interactive Table:** Build a responsive table to list clinical trials with columns like condition, sponsor, phase, age group, gender, and recruitment status.
3. **Filter and Search:** Allow users to search for trials by condition (e.g., asthma) and apply filters for parameters like age group, gender, and recruitment status.
4. **Detailed Trial View:** Enable users to click on a trial to view detailed information, such as participation criteria, trial location, and drug being tested.
5. **User-Friendly Interface:** Ensure the dashboard is intuitive and accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## **Key Features**
1. **Search by Condition:** Users can input a condition (e.g., asthma) to fetch all related trials.
2. **Dynamic Table:** Display trial data in a table format with sortable and filterable columns.
3. **Recruitment Status:** Highlight recruitment statuses like recruiting, not recruiting, or completed.
4. **Participation Criteria:** Show detailed eligibility criteria, including age, gender, and health status.
5. **API Integration:** Leverage REST APIs to fetch real-time data.
6. **Responsive Design:** Ensure compatibility across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend:** React.js for building the user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express.js for handling API requests (optional, if data needs preprocessing).
- **API Integration:** REST API provided by clinicaltrials.gov.
- **Styling:** CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for modular and responsive styling.
- **Build Tool:** Vite for project setup and development.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: API Integration**
1. Understand the clinicaltrials.gov API documentation.
2. Fetch trial data using endpoints like `/API/V2/query`.
3. Test API responses using tools like Postman or directly in the browser.

### **Step 2: Build the User Interface**
1. Create a React app using Vite.
2. Design a home page with a search bar for entering the condition (e.g., asthma).
3. Implement a dynamic table to display trial data.
4. Add a sidebar or modal for detailed trial information.

### **Step 3: Data Processing**
1. Parse API responses to extract relevant fields (e.g., title, sponsor, phase, status).
2. Handle edge cases like missing data or unknown statuses.
3. Implement pagination for large datasets.

### **Step 4: Filters and Sorting**
1. Add filters for parameters like age group, gender, and trial phase.
2. Enable sorting by columns (e.g., recruitment status, sponsor).

### **Step 5: Detailed View**
1. Create a modal or new page to display detailed trial information.
2. Include fields like participation criteria, location, and drug details.

### **Step 6: Testing and Deployment**
1. Test the dashboard for functionality, responsiveness, and performance.
2. Deploy the app using platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS.

## **Sample API Endpoints**
- **Fetch Trials:**  
  `https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/query?condition=asthma`

- **Trial Details:**  
  `https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/study/{NCTID}`

---

## **Challenges and Solutions**
1. **Large Dataset Handling:**
   - Implement pagination and lazy loading to manage large datasets efficiently.
2. **API Rate Limits:**
   - Cache responses or use a backend server to reduce API calls.
3. **Data Inconsistencies:**
   - Handle missing or ambiguous data gracefully in the UI.

---

## **Expected Outcomes**
- A functional and interactive dashboard for querying clinical trial data.
- Enhanced accessibility and usability of clinical trial information.
- A scalable and maintainable codebase for future enhancements.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. Add user authentication for saving favorite trials or search queries.
2. Visualize trial data using charts and graphs.
3. Integrate additional APIs for global clinical trial data.
4. Support multiple languages for a broader audience.
