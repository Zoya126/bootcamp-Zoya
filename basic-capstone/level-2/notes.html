    <h1>Key Learnings - Web Component Development</h1>

    <h2>Important Points I Learned:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="important"><strong>Custom HTML Tags:</strong> Web components allow you to create custom, reusable HTML elements that can be used just like regular HTML tags, such as `<city-weather city="Los Angeles"></city-weather>`. This enables more modular and maintainable code.</li>
        <li class="important"><strong>Encapsulation of Styles and Code:</strong> Web components encapsulate their styles and JavaScript, ensuring that they do not interfere with other parts of the page. This makes it easier to develop complex applications without worrying about global style or script conflicts.</li>
        <li class="important"><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Web components can be used with any JavaScript framework (like React, Angular, or Vue) or even on their own. This makes them highly flexible and reusable across different projects, enhancing productivity and consistency.</li>
        <li class="important"><strong>Reusable Widgets:</strong> By creating reusable components like the weather widget, developers can easily integrate them into different parts of the application or across different projects, reducing the amount of repetitive code.</li>
        <li class="important"><strong>Cleaner Code and Faster Development:</strong> With Web Components, you can break down your website into smaller, reusable components, leading to cleaner code, easier maintenance, and faster development cycles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Features to Consider:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="feature"><strong>Custom Elements:</strong> Custom elements are the core of web components. They allow you to define your own HTML tags with custom functionality, which can be reused and extended.</li>
        <li class="feature"><strong>Shadow DOM:</strong> The Shadow DOM is a key feature of web components that allows you to encapsulate the styles and behavior of the component, preventing them from leaking into the global document.</li>
        <li class="feature"><strong>HTML Templates:</strong> HTML templates can be used in web components to define the structure of the component without rendering it immediately. This helps in creating more efficient and reusable components.</li>
        <li class="feature"><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Web components allow you to define custom events that can be listened to by other parts of your application. This makes them highly interactive and flexible for various use cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important Web Component Concepts:</h2>
    <div class="concept">
        <h3>1. Custom Elements</h3>
        <p>Custom elements allow developers to define their own HTML tags with custom functionality. For example, a `<city-weather>` tag can be defined to display weather information for a specific city. This makes it easy to reuse the same functionality across different parts of a website or app.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
        <h3>2. Shadow DOM</h3>
        <p>The Shadow DOM is a critical feature of web components. It allows a component to have its own isolated DOM tree, preventing its styles and scripts from affecting the rest of the page. This encapsulation makes it easier to create reusable components without worrying about style or script conflicts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
        <h3>3. HTML Templates</h3>
        <p>HTML templates are a powerful tool in web components. They allow you to define the structure of a component without rendering it immediately. This ensures that the component's content is only rendered when necessary, improving performance and reusability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
        <h3>4. Event Handling</h3>
        <p>Web components support custom events, which can be dispatched and listened to by other parts of the application. This makes web components highly interactive and flexible, allowing them to respond to user actions or other events in the application.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Example - Weather Widget:</h2>
    <p>The weather widget is a great example of a web component. The `<city-weather>` component accepts a `city` attribute, which can be dynamically updated by the user. Here's a simple example of how it can be implemented:</p>
    <pre>
        &lt;city-weather city="Los Angeles"&gt;&lt;/city-weather&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>By default, the widget displays the weather for Los Angeles. The user can enter a city name in a form, and the component will update to display the weather for the selected city.</p>

    <h2>Web Components in Frameworks:</h2>
    <div class="concept">
        <h3>1. React</h3>
        <p>Web components can be used within React applications. React can interact with custom elements, and you can pass data to and from the component using attributes and properties. However, React doesn't have full support for the Shadow DOM, so developers need to manage it manually when using web components in React.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
        <h3>2. Angular</h3>
        <p>Angular has built-in support for web components, and developers can easily use custom elements in Angular applications. Angular can also interact with web components' attributes and events, making them a great choice for building reusable UI elements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
        <h3>3. Vue</h3>
        <p>Vue.js can also integrate web components, allowing developers to use custom elements as part of their Vue applications. Vue provides a simple API for passing data and events between Vue components and web components.</p>
    </div>
