    <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
    <p class="review">The color contrast is somewhat effective, but some areas feel too harsh, and a more thoughtful color palette could improve overall aesthetics.</p>
  </div>

    <h2>Exercise 3</h2>
    <p class="review">Hover effects and icon-based navigation add a dynamic touch, enhancing the overall user experience beautifully.</p>
