  <p>Reviewing the design submission for <a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/" target="_blank"> Shilpa</a>:</p>


  <div class="exercise 1">
    <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
    <p class="review">Padding and margin adjustments are perfectly done, creating a well-balanced and clean layout.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="exercise 2">
    <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
    <p class="review">The color contrast is somewhat effective, but some areas feel too harsh, and a more thoughtful color palette could improve overall aesthetics.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="exercise 3">
    <h2>Exercise 3</h2>
    <p class="review">Hover effects and icon-based navigation add a dynamic touch, enhancing the overall user experience beautifully.</p>
