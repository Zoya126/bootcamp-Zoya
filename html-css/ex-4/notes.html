    <h1>Notes on Responsive Design and CSS Units</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction to CSS Units</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pixels (px):</strong> The most commonly used unit for fixed-length elements. It’s precise but not flexible for responsive design. Used when absolute control over the layout is necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Percentage (%):</strong> This unit is relative to the parent element. It’s useful for creating layouts that need to scale based on the container size. For example, using 50% for width will make the element take up half of the parent's width.</li>
            <li><strong>Viewport Height (vh) and Viewport Width (vw):</strong> These units are relative to the viewport size (the visible area of the browser window). 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height, and 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width. These units are useful for creating layouts that need to scale with the window size.</li>
            <li><strong>em and rem:</strong> Both of these units are relative to font sizes. <code>em</code> is relative to the font size of the parent element, while <code>rem</code> is relative to the root font size. These are helpful for scalable typography and spacing.</li>
            <li><strong>ch:</strong> This unit represents the width of the character "0" in the current font. It’s useful for setting widths or padding related to character lengths.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Responsive Design Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scaling Layouts Using Relative Units:</strong> By using percentage-based widths, vh, and vw, elements can scale proportionally with the viewport, making the design more flexible and responsive.</li>
            <li><strong>min(), max(), and clamp():</strong> These functions allow dynamic adjustments to properties:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>min():</strong> Ensures that a property does not exceed a specific maximum value. For example, <code>font-size: min(5vw, 30px);</code> ensures that the font size does not exceed 30px but scales with the viewport width.</li>
                    <li><strong>max():</strong> Sets a minimum value for properties. Example: <code>font-size: max(14px, 2vw);</code> ensures that the font size is at least 14px but can grow with the viewport.</li>
                    <li><strong>clamp():</strong> Allows you to set a fluid range for a property. For example, <code>font-size: clamp(16px, 4vw, 24px);</code> ensures the font size remains between 16px and 24px, scaling smoothly within that range.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fluid Typography:</strong> Using relative units like <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> for typography ensures that text scales proportionally with the viewport size, improving readability across different screen sizes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Level 1: Centered Layout</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Centering with %:</strong> Used percentage-based width and margin to center the content block horizontally and vertically.</li>
            <li><strong>Centering with vh and vw:</strong> Utilized viewport units to center the content both vertically and horizontally, making sure that the content block adjusts dynamically to the viewport size.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Level 2: Dynamic Scaling</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Font Sizes:</strong> Applied <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, and <code>clamp()</code> to font sizes to ensure they scale smoothly with the viewport width while respecting the set boundaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Scaling Widths:</strong> Used <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> to control the scaling of elements, ensuring they never exceed a certain size or become too small on smaller screens.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Level 3: Continuous Responsiveness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Avoiding Fixed Breakpoints:</strong> Instead of using fixed breakpoints (e.g., media queries), the design relied on fluid units and dynamic functions like <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, and <code>clamp()</code> to continuously adjust the layout based on the viewport size.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Grids:</strong> Created fluid grid layouts using percentages, vw, and vh, allowing for scalable and flexible designs that adapt to any screen size.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluid Typography:</strong> Ensured that the font size adjusted proportionally using <code>clamp()</code>, so the text was legible across all screen sizes without the need for media queries.</li>
        </ul>
